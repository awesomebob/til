# Today I (awesomebob) Learned

I learn by doing. Here are some of the things I have learned.

I have a Lenovo ThinkPad laptop, currently running Ubuntu GNOME 15.04 Vivid.
I use [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) as my text editor.
I use [Byobu](http://byobu.co/) with [tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) to manage my terminal.

Just because I have learned something does not mean that is is perfect, or even correct.
Feel free to increase my understanding by adding an Issue or Pull Request.
