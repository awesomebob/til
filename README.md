# Today I (awesomebob) Learned

I learn by doing. Here are some of the things I have learned [recently](https://github.com/awesomebob/til/commits/master).

I have a Lenovo ThinkPad laptop, currently running Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial.

I use [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) as my text editor.
I use [Byobu](http://byobu.co/) with [tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) to manage my terminal.
I recently installed the [i3 tiling window manager](http://i3wm.org/), and I'm liking it so far.

Just because I have learned something does not mean that is is perfect, or even correct.
Feel free to increase my understanding by adding an Issue or Pull Request.
